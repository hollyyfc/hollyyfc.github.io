# 👋 Hello there!

I am an aspiring data scientist and Master's student in the Department of  Statistical Science at Duke University, where I also obtained my Bachelor's in Statistical Science (Data Science Concentration) and a Minor in Computer Science. My academic journey has been marked by a deep research commitment to statistical analysis, machine learning, and data science, with special focuses on natural language processing, Bayesian statistics, and creative data visualizations. Take a look of my previous **research** and **intern projects** in R and Python, and let me know if you are interested! [👉View My Resume](/Yifan%20(Holly)%20Cui%20Resume.pdf)

Beyond academia, I was an active member of the Duke community, contributing as a Project Manager & Data Analyst in the [Duke Impact Investing Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/diig/) and as the Chief Technology Officer in the [Duke Statistical Science Majors Union](https://dukegroups.com/ssmu/home/). Additionally, I have been a **teaching assistant** with 3+ years of experience. Feel free to reach out for project advice and business case studies. 

In my free time, I balance my academic pursuits with diverse interests such as boxing, cycling, and music producing. I was also a board member of [UCSB International Student Advisory Board](https://internationalvistas.blogspot.com/) advocating for international students' rights. Read more and get engaged!
