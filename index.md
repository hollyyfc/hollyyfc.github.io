# 👋 Hello there!

I am an aspiring data scientist and Master's student in the Department of  Statistical Science at Duke University, where I also obtained my Bachelor's in Statistical Science (Data Science Concentration) and a Minor in Computer Science. 

- My academic journey has been marked by a deep research commitment to statistical analysis, machine learning, and data science, with special focuses on natural language processing, Bayesian statistics, and creative data visualizations. Take a look of my previous [research](/research) and [intern projects](/projects) in R and Python, and let me know if you are interested! 
- Beyond academia, I actively contribute as a Project Manager & Data Analyst @ [Duke Impact Investing Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/diig/) and as the Chief Technology Officer @ [Duke Statistical Science Majors Union](https://dukegroups.com/ssmu/home/). Additionally, I have been a [teaching assistant](/teaching) with 3+ years of experience. Feel free to reach out for project advice and business case studies. 
- In my free time, I do 🥊 / 🚴‍♀️ / 🎹 / 🧁
