This project was completed with Amy Weng, Heidi Smith, and Jennifer Ouyang for the Spring 2023 section of COMPSCI 390: Computer Science Special Topics at Duke University. 

If we wanted to be cutesy, we could start this with a clichÃ© â€” but that would be like beating a dead horse, now wouldnâ€™t it? Following the work of [van Cranenburgh (2018)](https://aclanthology.org/W18-4504/) on the presence of clichÃ©s in modern Dutch literature versus their literary quality, we wanted to explore whether this phenomenon was replicable in 19th-century English novels. Expanding on the original question, we explored the markers of scholarly acclaim, quality, and popularity based on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) and [Modern Language Association](https://www.mla.org/) data as compared to the percentage of words in an authorsâ€™ texts from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) that contain clichÃ©d expressions. Our results show that, similarly to the original study, scholarly acclaim has a negative correlation with clichÃ© ratios, whereas the other two predictor variables are positively correlated. We also summarize our findings vis-Ã -vis the clichÃ©s themselves, which are present in our corpus.
