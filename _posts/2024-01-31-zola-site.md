On my journey to create a new personal site (yes, a **new site** other than the one you are viewing now ðŸ˜Š), I decided to go with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static site generator that's built on [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and spiced it up with the [Tera template engine](https://github.com/Keats/tera) through an exploratory mindset and a passion in trying out new tools. The site is hosted on GitLab, making it easily accessible for anyone curious about my background and what I've been up to. 

The layout of the site is pretty straightforward. It kicks off with a home page that features a big, animated welcomeâ€”basically, my digital "hello" to the world. There's also a section that gives a rundown of my studies and work experience, all mixed in with texts, links, and a few emojis to keep things interesting. For anyone looking into the nitty-gritty of what I can do, there's a skills tab that lists out my technical abilities with some neat icons for visual flair. And, of course, there's a projects tab where I've highlighted some of the work I'm most proud of, complete with links and images to give you a better look at what I've done. One thing to note is that the site doesn't have a traditional menu or navbar. Instead, I played around with the theme's structure to create different sections that stand out on their own, thanks to some customizable CSS and HTML structures.

However, it hasn't all been smooth sailing. The animated theme I chose, [Particle](https://www.getzola.org/themes/particle/) by [Silvano Sallese](https://github.com/svavs), is a bit behind on compatibility with the latest versions of Zola. This hiccup has left the GitLab-hosted site looking pretty bare-bones at the moment. Despite this, the code and everything else worked perfectly fine locally and made it through all the CI/CD checks for a successful build. I'm in the process of reaching out to the theme's author in hopes of getting everything up to date and fully functional online. In the meantime, I've got my main portfolio site here, built with Ruby and the Jekyll theme So Simple, as a solid backup for anyone looking to see more of my work!
