The project is presented by [Dr. Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel](https://mine-cr.com/) (Professor of the Practice of Statistical Science, Duke University) and cohosted by me in collaboration with [Duke Center for Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.duke.edu/). The project was originally presented in [Coding Out Loud, Episode 2](https://www.youtube.com/live/b0d4vrJqKwM?si=AwZ6-VhK7phYAcBt).

## About

One hour, one dataset, a pair of programmers. In each episode Dr. Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel will team up with an undergraduate student to collaboratively explore and visualize a dataset with the goal of both answering questions of mutual interest with the dataset and showcasing the process of doing data science, with R, collaboratively.

## Details

The goal of this project is to create a table summarizing the shades of several top foundation products from assorted brands. The dataset `Makeup Shades` was first gathered for the article titled [*The Naked Truth*](https://pudding.cool/2021/03/foundation-names/), published on *The Pudding*, and then featured as a *Tidy Tuesday* dataset in 2021. The purpose of the table we create in this project is to help customers compare the color shades of various products and make picking the right product that might offer the right shade for them easier. The exploration also offers an opportunity to investigate the biases in names used for makeup shades, which is the focus of *The Naked Truth* article.  

To accomplish our goal, we use **R** and primarily the [**gt**](https://gt.rstudio.com/) package. Leveraging **HTML**, the final outcome is a table with plenty of visual elements such as color swatches.
