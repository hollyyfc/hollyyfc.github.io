These two projects were completed with Elyse McFalls for the Fall 2023 section of [STA 522: Study Design and Causal Inference](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~jerry/sta322n522/sta322n522s18.html) at Duke University. 

## Project 1 - Estimating U.S. Demographics and Political Trends: A Stratified Sampling Approach Using the Horvitz-Thompson Estimator

ðŸš© **Keywords: Stratified Sampling Design, Horvitz-Thompson Estimator, Demographic Data Analysis, Statistical Inference, Census Data Interpretation**

The project focuses on using county-level data to understand various aspects of the United States, such as population density, demographics, and political preferences. The data was sourced from the *U.S. Census Bureau* and *MIT's Election Data and Science Labs*, covering the period from 2010 to 2020. A stratified sampling design was chosen, with each of the 50 states serving as individual strata, and the District of Columbia treated as a singleton stratum. The sample size was adjusted to ensure representation from every state, and the sampling frame excluded U.S. territories and remote islands due to logistical challenges and their limited impact on national survey results.

The methodology involved a detailed data collection process for county-level political preferences and demographic compositions, focusing on the Hispanic or Latino population and the aging U.S. population. The project employed the Horvitz-Thompson estimator for statistical analysis, ensuring that each state in the U.S. was accounted for and reducing the variance in population estimates. The data analysis involved estimating the average population density per county, the total number of Hispanic or Latino individuals, the change in this population between 2010 and 2020, voting preferences in the 2020 election, and the proportion of the population aged 65 or above in both 2020 and 2010.

The results revealed insights into various aspects of the U.S. population and political landscape. Key findings included estimates of the average population density per county, the total number of Hispanic or Latino individuals in 2020, and the change in this demographic over a decade. The study also provided estimates of voting preferences in the 2020 election and highlighted the increasing proportion of the U.S. population aged 65 or above, indicating a trend toward an aging population. The overlapping confidence intervals in certain estimates suggested the need for further research to understand these demographic shifts fully. Future studies might explore the factors driving these changes and their implications for health care policies, social security benefits, and other societal aspects.
