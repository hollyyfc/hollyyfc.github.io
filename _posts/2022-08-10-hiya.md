This project was completed during my 2022 summer internship at [Hiya](https://www.hiya.com/), a spam / robocall filtering company based in Seattle, WA. Team credits to Aman Singh, Marcus Chen under the supervision of Tim Spillane, Damon Resnick, and Bryce Johnson. 

The main objective of the project is to design a robocall screening process to determine if an audio is from a known robocall database (i.e., *honeypot*). Here, a **robocall** means an automated telephone call which delivers a recorded message, typically on behalf of a political party or telemarketing company according to *Oxford Languages*. Notice that robocalls are different from promotional or sales calls by real human callers, so we are only able to cut the dialing process for robocalls but not others under regulations. The company's product at the time generates call identification and transcriptions to the users. Our improvements resides on automatically identifying robocalls through NLP processes and hanging up / blocking for the users if robocalls are detected.

Project goals: 

- Build a ground-truth research dataset and a honeypot library 
- Investigate the differences between selected similarity metrics and pick the one with the best performance
- Quantify the relationship between audio duration and performance of robocall classification
- Find the best method that satisfy both screening accuracy and user experience
