This project was completed as an independent final study for the Spring 2024 section of [STA 640: Causal Inference](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~fl35/CausalInferenceClass.html) at Duke University.

After pursuing deeper into causal inference, the topic of noncompliance fascinates me. In a common setting, we expect a completely randomized study between the treatment and control arms, such that Z -> Y. However, sometimes confounding occurs post-treatment (i.e., different from the pre-treatment confounders relating to covariates), such that a post-treatment confounder D happens after Z but before Y: Z -> D -> Y.
